      <Page>I'll be back there soon. I kind of like it down here.</Page>
      <Page>It's hard being the best magical talking anglerfish there is, you know? Lots of pressure.</Page>
      <Page>Been nice to get some fresh air. Metaphorically speaking.</Page>
      <Page>What?? What do you mean I'm not the best magical talking anglerfish!?</Page>
      <Page>You'd better leave while you still can. I'm getting hungry.</Page>
    </Dialogue>
    <Dialogue>
      <Page>Yeah, I thought they would notice I was gone. An anglerfish like me going missing is nothing small.</Page>
      <Page>I am pretty small though, so maybe it isn't such a big event.</Page>
    </Dialogue>
    <Dialogue>
      <Page>They put up posters last time I disappeared. And the time before that.</Page>
      <Page>I hope they don't do it again. It really injures my reuptation of being the great Ernesto.</Page>
    </Dialogue>
    <Dialogue>
      <Page>Yeah, I figured they would be worrying about me.</Page>
      <Page>Hey, what if you went up there and acted like I was invisible? That would be funny.</Page>
      <Page>Actually... that would be amazing! Everyone would think I had superpowers! I would be famous! Ernesto, The Magical Talking Invisible Anglerfish!</Page>
      <Page>But... what if someone asks me to prove it?</Page>
      <Page>I changed my mind. Please don't do that.</Page>
    </Dialogue>
    <Dialogue>
      <Page>Yeah, I figured they would be worried about me.</Page>
      <Page>Tell them I'm being held hostage by evil alien overlords. That's sure to give them a scare.</Page>
      <Page>I'm just kidding.</Page>
      <Page>You weren't... actually planning on doing that, were you?</Page>
      <Page>Maybe you're the one I'm being held hostage by.</Page>
    </Dialogue>
    <Dialogue>
      <Page>Go tell them I'll be back eventually, they don't need to worry.</Page>
      <Page>Why are you still here? Aren't you gonna go tell them I'm safe?</Page>
      <Page>Wait... it must be my bulb! It must be hypnotizing you!</Page>
      <Page>Spin around! I compel you! Why aren't you doing anything?</Page>
      <Page>Oh well... either the bulb is dysfunctional, or you are.</Page>
